Submission

When you're ready to submit your project go back to the Portal, click on the Project 1, and follow the instructions to submit.

Start by creating a text file with a list of websites, books, forums, blog posts, Github repositories etc. that you referred to or used in this submission (Add N/A if you did not use such resources).
If you want to submit your code through a "Link to Project", copy the code that passed the auto-evaluator into another text file, upload that code onto Github and send us the link. Please use a separate repository for each project.
If you instead want to submit your code through "Upload a Zip", copy the code that passed the auto-evaluator into another text file, compress the entire directory, and submit that zip file.
You should be submitting: (a) All of your Resource files (b) HTML and (c) CSS exactly like this folder structure:

index.html
references.txt
/css/main.css
/css/bootstrap.min.css
/images/mug.png
It can take us up to 2 weeks to evaluate the project so keep checking back for updates.

If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at frontend-project@udacity.com.

Next Steps

Feel free to hop onto the forums to help your fellow students, or work on the optional bonus project of "Building a Portfolio" while you wait to receive your evaluation.
